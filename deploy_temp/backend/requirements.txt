# NOTE (Windows / Python 3.13):
# The beautify stack (CodeFormer/GFPGAN/Real-ESRGAN/BasicSR + torch/torchvision) often fails to
# install on Py3.13 due to missing wheels / sdist issues. It's not required for InsightFace face crop.
# If you need beautify, use a dedicated Python 3.10/3.11 venv and install those deps separately.
